**Brain Tumor Risk Assessment Report**

Dear [Patient's Name],

We are writing to share with you the results of your recent assessment. We understand that receiving news about potential health issues can be distressing, and we want to assure you that our team is here to support you every step of the way.

Our evaluation has identified a range of symptoms that have raised concerns about the possibility of a brain tumor. These include vomiting, weakness, nausea, balance issues, seizures, headaches, memory problems, vision difficulties, and speech challenges. We take these symptoms very seriously and want to assure you that we are taking immediate action to investigate further.

Our assessment indicates that your risk level is **94%**, which means there is a **VERY HIGH** likelihood of a brain tumor being present. This is a critical situation, and we urge you to seek urgent medical attention.

We recommend the following next steps:

* An MRI scan of your brain with contrast will be scheduled as soon as possible to help us better understand what's going on.
* We would like to schedule a consultation with our neurosurgery team to discuss the results and develop a plan for further treatment.

Please know that you are not alone in this process. Our team is committed to providing you with compassionate care and support throughout your journey. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

We will be in touch soon to schedule these appointments and provide you with more information about what to expect.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
