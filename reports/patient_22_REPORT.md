As part of our evaluation, we considered various factors, including your reported symptoms (none) and calculated a Symptom Risk Score of 0/100, indicating **LOW Severity**. This score suggests that there is no immediate cause for concern.

Our analysis also indicates an estimated brain tumor probability of **5%**, which falls into the category of **VERY LOW Risk**. We want to reassure you that this result is excellent news and should bring you significant peace of mind.

Based on our assessment, we are not concerned about any underlying conditions that may require immediate attention. However, as a precautionary measure, we recommend the following next steps:
