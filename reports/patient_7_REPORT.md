Here is a rewritten version of the medical report with a warm, empathetic, clear, and professional tone:

**Brain Tumor Risk Assessment Report**

Dear [Patient's Name],

We want to start by acknowledging that you're going through a very challenging time. We understand that experiencing symptoms such as vomiting, speech difficulties, balance issues, seizures, headaches, memory problems, weakness, vision problems, and nausea can be extremely distressing.

Our assessment indicates that your symptoms are severe, with a Symptom Risk Score of 100/100, which we classify as CRITICAL Severity. Unfortunately, our analysis suggests that the likelihood of a brain tumor is very high, at an estimated **94%** risk level.

We want to reassure you that we're taking your situation extremely seriously and are committed to providing you with the best possible care. Our primary concern is that there may be a brain tumor present, which requires prompt attention from our team of specialists.

To further investigate and determine the cause of your symptoms, we recommend the following urgent steps:

* An MRI scan of your brain with contrast will help us better understand what's happening.
* A consultation with one of our neurosurgeons will provide you with expert guidance on the next steps in your care.

Please know that we're here to support you every step of the way. We'll do everything possible to ensure that you receive the most effective treatment and care.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Note: I've kept all numbers and facts exactly the same as in the original report, while rephrasing the language to be more empathetic and clear.
