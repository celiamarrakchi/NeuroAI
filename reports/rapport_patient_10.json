  "explanation": "Here is a rewritten version of the medical report with a warm, empathetic, clear, and professional tone:\n\n**Confidential Medical Report**\n\n**Patient Information**\n\n* **Patient ID**: 10\n* **Age**: 22 years old\n* **Sex**: Male\n\n**Presenting Symptoms**\n\nOur patient has been experiencing a range of concerning symptoms, including weakness, memory problems, balance issues, headaches, seizures, vomiting, speech difficulties, nausea, and vision problems. We understand that these symptoms can be distressing and affect daily life.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n\nBased on the severity of these symptoms, our team has assessed the risk as **CRITICAL Severity**, with a Symptom Risk Score of 100/100. This indicates a high level of concern for potential underlying conditions.\n\n**Estimated Brain Tumor Probability**\n\nOur analysis suggests that there is a **94%** probability of a brain tumor being present, which is classified as **VERY HIGH Risk**. We want to assure you that we are taking this situation very seriously and will work diligently to determine the cause of these symptoms.\n\n**Primary Clinical Concern**\n\nGiven the severity of the symptoms and the estimated risk, our primary clinical concern is the possibility of a brain tumor.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps**\n\nTo further investigate and determine the best course of treatment, we recommend the following:\n\n* **Urgent MRI Brain Scan with Contrast**: This imaging test will help us visualize any potential abnormalities in the brain.\n* **Neurosurgery Consultation**: Our team of neurosurgeons will review the results of the MRI scan and provide guidance on the next steps for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nWe want to reassure you that we are committed to providing compassionate care and support throughout this process. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.",
