**Brain Tumor Risk Assessment Report**

Dear Anis's Family,

We are writing to share our concerns about Anis's recent symptoms. As his healthcare team, we want to assure you that we are committed to providing him with the best possible care.

**Symptoms Experienced by Anis**: Our records indicate that Anis has been experiencing a range of concerning symptoms, including headaches, memory problems, balance issues, vomiting, vision problems, nausea, speech difficulties, seizures, and weakness. We understand how distressing these symptoms can be for both Anis and his loved ones.

**Risk Assessment Results**: Based on our evaluation, we have assigned a Symptom Risk Score of 100/100, indicating **CRITICAL Severity**. Our analysis also suggests that the likelihood of a brain tumor is **94%**, which is classified as **VERY HIGH Risk**.

**Primary Clinical Concern**: We are primarily concerned about the possibility of a brain tumor, and we want to emphasize that this concern is not a diagnosis, but rather a suspicion that requires further investigation.

**Recommended Next Steps**: To better understand Anis's condition and determine the best course of treatment, we recommend the following:

* **Urgent MRI Brain Scan with Contrast**: This imaging test will help us visualize the brain and identify any potential abnormalities.
* **Neurosurgery Consultation**: We would like to schedule a consultation with a neurosurgeon to discuss Anis's case in more detail and determine the next steps.

Please know that we are committed to supporting Anis and his family throughout this process. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Anis's Healthcare Team

**URGENCY LEVEL: IMMEDIATE**
