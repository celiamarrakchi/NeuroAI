Here is a rewritten version of the medical report with a warm, empathetic, clear, and professional tone:

**Brain Tumor Risk Assessment Report**

Dear [Patient's Name],

I am writing to share with you the results of your recent evaluation for potential brain tumor symptoms. I want to start by acknowledging that it takes great courage to seek medical attention, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Our assessment has revealed a concerning pattern of symptoms, including memory problems, balance issues, headaches, nausea, vision disturbances, vomiting, and seizures. These symptoms have led us to assign a **Symptom Risk Score** of 100/100, indicating a **CRITICAL Severity** level.

Regrettably, our analysis suggests that the likelihood of a brain tumor is **94%**, which falls into the **VERY HIGH Risk** category. I want to assure you that we take this situation very seriously and are committed to providing you with the best possible care.

Our primary concern at this time is the possibility of a brain tumor, and we recommend the following urgent steps:

* An MRI brain scan with contrast will be scheduled as soon as possible to help us better understand what's happening.
* A consultation with our neurosurgery team will also be arranged to discuss potential treatment options and next steps.

Please know that you are not alone in this journey. Our entire medical team is dedicated to supporting you through this challenging time, and we will work closely together to ensure that you receive the care and attention you need.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. We are here for you every step of the way.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

**URGENCY LEVEL: IMMEDIATE**
