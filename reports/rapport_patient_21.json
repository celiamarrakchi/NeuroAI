  "explanation": "Here is a rewritten version of the medical report with a warm, empathetic, clear, and professional tone:\n\n**Brain Tumor Risk Assessment Report**\n\nDear [Patient's Name],\n\nI want to start by acknowledging that I can only imagine how concerning and overwhelming it must be to experience such severe symptoms. Please know that you are not alone, and we are committed to providing you with the best possible care.\n\nOur assessment indicates that your symptoms, which include vision problems, nausea, memory issues, seizures, vomiting, speech difficulties, headache, balance issues, and weakness, have a **CRITICAL Severity** rating of 100/100. This is a serious concern that requires immediate attention.\n\nBased on our evaluation, we estimate that the likelihood of you having a brain tumor is **94%**, which is classified as a **VERY HIGH Risk**. I want to reassure you that this does not mean a definitive diagnosis has been made, but rather it highlights the need for further investigation.\n\nOur primary concern at this time is the possibility of a brain tumor, and we recommend the following next steps:\n\n* An urgent MRI scan with contrast will be scheduled to help us better understand what's going on.\n* We would like to consult with our neurosurgery team to discuss the best course of action for your specific situation.\n\nPlease know that you are in good hands, and we will do everything possible to support you through this challenging time. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",
