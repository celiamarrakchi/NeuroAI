  "explanation": "Here is a rewritten version of the medical report with a warm, empathetic, clear, and professional tone:\n\n**Confidential Medical Report**\n\n**Patient Information**\n\n* Patient ID: 18\n* Age: 20\n* Sex: Male\n\n**Presenting Symptoms**\n\nOur patient has been experiencing a range of concerning symptoms, including seizures, vision problems, headaches, nausea, balance issues, weakness, memory problems, vomiting, and speech difficulties. These symptoms have significantly impacted our patient's quality of life.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n\nBased on the severity and complexity of these symptoms, we have conducted a thorough risk assessment. The results indicate a **100/100 Symptom Risk Score**, which is classified as CRITICAL Severity. This suggests that our patient's symptoms are severe and may be indicative of an underlying condition that requires immediate attention.\n\n**Estimated Brain Tumor Probability**\n\nOur analysis indicates a **94% probability** of a brain tumor, which is categorized as VERY HIGH Risk. We understand that this news can be alarming and overwhelming for both our patient and their loved ones.\n\n**Primary Clinical Concern**\n\nGiven the high likelihood of a brain tumor, our primary clinical concern is to rule out this possibility and determine the best course of action. We are committed to providing our patient with compassionate care and support throughout this process.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps**\n\nTo further evaluate our patient's condition and develop an effective treatment plan, we recommend the following:\n\n* An urgent MRI brain scan with contrast to provide a detailed image of the brain\n* A consultation with a neurosurgeon to discuss potential surgical options and determine the best course of action\n\nWe will continue to work closely with our patient and their family to ensure that they receive the highest level of care and support throughout this challenging time.",
