Here is a rewritten version of the medical report with a warm, empathetic, clear, and professional tone:

**Brain Tumor Risk Assessment Report for Houssem (ID: 23)**

Dear Houssem,

We appreciate you coming in to see us about your recent headache. We understand that this can be a concerning symptom, and we want to assure you that we're taking a thorough approach to understanding its cause.

Our assessment suggests that the likelihood of a brain tumor is very low, at only 5%. This means that there's a less than 1 in 20 chance that your headache is related to a tumor. While this risk is still present, it's essential to note that most headaches are caused by more common and treatable conditions.

Our primary concern is that the cause of your headache is likely benign (non-cancerous). However, we want to take further steps to confirm this and rule out any other potential causes.

To move forward, we recommend a head CT scan to help us better understand what's causing your symptoms. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment with you to review the results and discuss next steps.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We're committed to providing you with the best possible care and support throughout this process.

Thank you for trusting us with your health.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
