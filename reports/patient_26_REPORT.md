**Brain Tumor Risk Assessment Report for Mr. Hamoudi**

Dear Mr. Hamoudi,

We are pleased to share with you the results of your recent risk assessment for brain tumors. Our team has carefully evaluated your medical history and current symptoms (or lack thereof) to provide a comprehensive understanding of your situation.

**Your Current Status:**
At 80 years old, you are considered a senior adult, but our assessment indicates that your risk level is very low. Your Symptom Risk Score is 0/100, which means we have not identified any concerning symptoms at this time.

**Estimated Brain Tumor Probability:**
Our calculations suggest that the likelihood of a brain tumor is only **5%**, which is considered VERY LOW. This is reassuring news, and we are confident in our assessment.

**Primary Clinical Concern:**
Based on your evaluation, it's likely that any potential issues are benign (non-cancerous). We want to emphasize that this is not a definitive diagnosis, but rather an indication of the low likelihood of a serious condition.

**Next Steps:**
To further confirm our findings and ensure your continued health, we recommend:

1. A head CT scan to rule out any underlying conditions.
2. Regular follow-up appointments with us to monitor your progress and address any new concerns that may arise.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns about this report. We are committed to providing you with the best possible care and support throughout this process.

Thank you for entrusting us with your healthcare needs, Mr. Hamoudi. We look forward to working with you further.

Sincerely,
[Your Medical Team]
