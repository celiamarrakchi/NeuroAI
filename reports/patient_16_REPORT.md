Here is a rewritten version of the medical report with a warm, empathetic, clear, and professional tone:

**Brain Tumor Risk Assessment Report**

Dear [Patient's Name],

We are writing to inform you of our findings regarding your recent symptoms. We understand that this news can be distressing, and we want to assure you that we are here to support you every step of the way.

Our assessment indicates that you have been experiencing a range of concerning symptoms, including vomiting, memory problems, seizures, headaches, speech difficulties, vision problems, nausea, weakness, and balance issues. Our symptom risk score is 100/100, which suggests that your symptoms are severe and warrant immediate attention.

Unfortunately, our analysis also suggests that there is a **94%** probability of a brain tumor being the underlying cause of these symptoms. We want to emphasize that this is not a definitive diagnosis, but rather an indication of the high likelihood of a brain tumor being present.

Our primary concern at this time is the possibility of a brain tumor, and we strongly recommend that you undergo an urgent MRI brain scan with contrast as soon as possible. This will help us to confirm or rule out the presence of a tumor. Additionally, we would like to schedule a consultation with our neurosurgery team to discuss further evaluation and treatment options.

Please know that we are committed to providing you with the best possible care, and we will do everything in our power to support you through this challenging time. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Thank you for trusting us with your care.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Note: I've kept all numbers and facts exactly the same as in the original report, while using a more empathetic and supportive tone.
