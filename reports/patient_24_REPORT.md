Here is a rewritten version of the medical report with a warm, empathetic, clear, and professional tone:

**Brain Tumor Risk Assessment Report for Nodhir (ID: 24)**

Dear [Nodhir's Family/Support System],

We want to start by acknowledging that we understand this news can be overwhelming. We're here to support you every step of the way.

Our assessment indicates that Nodhir is experiencing a range of concerning symptoms, including balance issues, nausea, memory problems, seizures, headaches, vision problems, weakness, speech difficulties, and vomiting. These symptoms have led us to assign a **Symptom Risk Score** of 100/100, indicating a critical severity level.

Our analysis suggests that there is a **94% probability** of a brain tumor being present, which we categorize as a **VERY HIGH Risk**. We want to emphasize that this is not a definitive diagnosis, but rather an indication that further testing and evaluation are urgently needed.

As a result, our primary clinical concern is the possibility of a brain tumor, and we strongly recommend the following next steps:

1. **Urgent MRI brain with contrast**: This imaging test will help us better understand the structure and potential location of any tumor.
2. **Neurosurgery consult**: We will schedule an appointment for Nodhir to meet with our neurosurgeon team, who will discuss treatment options and create a personalized plan.

Please know that we're committed to providing compassionate care throughout this process. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
