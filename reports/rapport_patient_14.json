We take these symptoms very seriously, and our assessment has led us to conclude that your risk level is **CRITICAL** (100/100).\n\nRegrettably, our findings suggest a **VERY HIGH Risk** of a brain tumor, with an estimated probability of **94%**. This diagnosis requires immediate attention and further investigation.\n\nOur primary concern at this time is the possibility of a brain tumor, which necessitates prompt action to determine the best course of treatment. To that end, we recommend the following next steps:\n\n* An urgent MRI brain scan with contrast to help us better understand your condition\n* A consultation with our neurosurgery team to discuss potential surgical options and develop a personalized plan for your care\n\nPlease know that you are not alone in this journey.
